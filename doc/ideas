Baseline prediction
===================

Align all sequences from all clusters
One-hot encode them
Train classifier
Predict on all
Does the prediction make sense?
Which amino acids are important?



Refined prediction
==================

Align each cluster by itself
Within cluster, remove all positions with an entrypy score above certain level (or use gblocks?)
Align all shortened sequences from all clusters, get some sort of quality score of the alignment
Loop through process with different cutoff levels
Make plot of alignment score vs cutoff level

Pick one cutoff level
Validate on the cluster with good structures
Look at whether this leads to finding amino acids in the active site

Align all sequences
One-hot encode each sequence in the alignment
Train classifier to predict function
Predict on all
Does the prediction make sense?
Which amino acids are important?
Where those are in the structure of homology models?
Are the amino acids in the active site?

Possibly test a few of the sequences that should be specific in the lab to validate.


Possibly make use of CATH for prediction as well?
