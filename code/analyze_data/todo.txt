use api to get organisms with data for each EC
=> make plot of top 10 orgs


for each organism cross-reference with ncbi taxonomy to classify as eukaryote, bacterium, archaea or other
=> make rug plot of relative percentages
=> make histogram of relative percentages


use clustered BRENDA data (90%?) and for each EC fasta file get organism and classify as eukaryote, bacterium, archaea or other
=> make rug plot of relative percentages
=> make histogram of relative percentages

=> combine data and plot percentages of ec classes with both eukaryotes and bacteria that have data from both
=> do the same with archaea


=> Make pie or bar chart with superkingdom percentages for 1.1.3.8
=> Encode 1.1.3.8 using unirep
=> Make t-sne or mds plot of 1.1.3.8
=> Plot superkingdom identity
=> Plot cluster identity
=> Plot which have been characterized
=> Plot p-values for gaussian prediction
=> Plot identity thing as I did with 15
=> Plot which ones we selected
Then move on to experiment data
Soluble, active, etc
Substrates tested
Activities deteced
The operon structure, possible shift in annotation
Communalities between organisms? Some sort of Fischer test on phenotypes


Do I have a well-behaved class that I can compare to?
